            The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to
            do as part of their daily exercise routine.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Burpes</dt>
            <dd>
              Burpes are great, full body exercise to increase your strength and
              endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
              extend your hands froward, kick your foot back and then forward
              again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
            </dd>
            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>
              Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push
              up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position
              as long as you can.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>
              Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
              the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your
              chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are
              climbing a mountain).
